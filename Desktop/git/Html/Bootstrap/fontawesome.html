Add fontawesome icons to our buttons:
    Font Awesome is a convenient library of icons. These icons are vector graphics, stored in the <.svg> file format. These icons are treated just like fonts. You can specify their size using pixels, and they will assume the font size of their parent HTML elements.
    Adding Font Awesome: (put it on top of HTML)
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.5.0/css/font-awesome.min.css"/>
    The <i> element was originally used to make other elements italic, but now used for icons. Ex:
        <i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i>

Use responsive design wiht bootstrap fluid containers
    This time, Cat Photo App will be styled using popular Bootstrap responsive CSS framework. Bootstrap will figure out how wide screen is and respond by resizing HTML elements - hence <Responsive Design>. 
    With responsive design, no need to make mobile version. It'll look good no matter what size it is. Add Bootstrap by adding the following code:
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css"/>
    Then add <.container-fluid> like this:
        <div class="container-fluid"> </div>
        <!-- This class provides full width container, spanning the entire width of viewport. In addition, no need to declare .container-fluid in <style> -->

Make images mobile responsive:
    Using <img-responsive> class via bootstrap makes image fits perfectly with width of page. Ex:
        <img class="img-responsive" src="https://bit.ly/fcc-running-cats" alt="running cats">
        <!-- no need to declare .img-responsive in <style> -->

Center text with boostrap:
    <text-center> class makes the element being centered- better

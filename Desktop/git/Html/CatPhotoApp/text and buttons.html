Create a text field:
    Text inputs are convenient way to get input from user. Can create like this:
        <input type="text">
    Note: <input> elements are self-closing

Add placeholder text to a text field
    Placeholder text is what appears in your text <input> before user has input anything. Ex:
        <input type="text" placeholder="this is placeholder text">

Create a form element:
    Can build web forms that actually submit data to server using nothing more than HTML. Can do this by specifying action over <form> element. Ex:
        <form action="/url-where-you-want-to-submit-form-data"></form>

Add a submit button to a form:
    Clicking <submit> button will send data from your form to the URL specified with your form's <action> attribute. Ex:
        <button type="submit">this button submits the form</button>
        <!-- if the button element is placed within the form element, then the button will be created next to the text input -->

Use HTML5 to require a field
    Can require specific form fields so that your user won't be able to submit form until they've filled them out. Ex: if you want to make text input field required, you can just add the word <required> within your <input> element, you would use:
        <input type="text" required>    

Create a set of radio buttons:
    You can use <radio buttons> for questions where you want the user to only give you one answer. Radio buttons are type of <input>. Each of your radio buttons should be nested within its own <label> element. All related radio buttons should have the same <name> attribute. Ex:
        <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor</label>
        <!-- radio buttons create an option for users to choose -->

Create a set of checkboxes
    Forms commonly use <checkboxes> for questions that may have more than one answers. Checkboxess are a type of <input>. Each of your checkboxes should be nested within its own <label> element. All related checkbox inputs should have the same <name> attribute. Ex:
        <lable><input type="checkbox" name="personality">Loving</lable>

Check radio buttons and checkboxes by default
    You can set a checkbox or radio button to be checked by default using the <checked> attribute. To do this, add the word "checked" to the inside of an input element. Ex:
        <input type="radio" name="test-name" checked>

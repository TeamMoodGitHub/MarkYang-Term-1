Link to external pages with anchor elements:
    <a> elements, aka <anchor> elements are used to link to content outside of the current age. Explanation:
        <p>Here's a 
        <a href='http://freecodecamp.com'>
            link to Free Code Camp.com
            </a>
        for you to follow.</p>
    <!-- "Here's a" and "for you to follow" is normal text in a <p> element. <a> is anchor tag. <href> is anchor tag's href attribute. "link to Free Code Camp.com" is the link's text. -->

Make dead links using the hash symbol:
    Sometimes you want to add <a> elements to website before knowing where they will link. This is also handy when changing the behavior of a link using <jQuery>. Setting the <href> to a <#> turns it into a dead link. 
        <a href='#'></a>

Turn an img into a link:
    It is possible to nest image within an <a> element. Ex:
        <a href='#'><img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-running-cats" alt="Three kittens running towards the camera. "></a>

Header tags:
    <h1> </h1>
    <h2> </h2>

Paragraph tags:
    <p> </p>

Commenting out:
    <!--
    -->

Traditional placeholder text:
    lorem ipsum text

Changing text color:
    <h2 style="color:[insert color]">lorem ipsum text</h2>

Using CSS to style elements:
    <h2 style="color:red"> gives the individual element <h2> an inline style. A better way is to use CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). To style using CSS, declare as follows:
        <style>
            h2 {color:red;}
        </style>
    This style format makes all <h2> elements into color red rather than the individual <h2> that has the inline style. Note: it is very important to have '{' and '}' around each elements' style and ';' at the end

    Classes are reusable styles that can be added to CSS elements. Example declaration and applying it:
        <style>
            .blue-text {
                color: blue;
            }
        </style>
        <h2 class="blue-text">lorem ipsum text</h2>
        <!-- makes lorem ipsum text blue -->
    Note: classes in CSS beings with a '.' while HTML doesn't

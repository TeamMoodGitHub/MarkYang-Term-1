Set the ID of an element
    HTML elements also have <id> attribute other than elements. There are several benefits to using <id> attributes (more info in jQuery). <id> attributes should be unique. Browsers won't enforce this, but it is a widely agreed upon best practice. So PLEASE dont' give more than one element the same <id> attribute. Ex:
        <h2 id="cat-photo-app"></h2>
        <!-- gives h2 element id of cat-photo-app -->

Using ID attribute to style an element
    It is possible to use <id> like classes and style them using CSS. Ex of taking element with <id> attribute of <cat-photo-element> and give it the background color of green:
        <style>
            #cat-photo-element{
                background-color: green;
            }
        </style>
    Note: inside <style> </style>, always reference classes using '.' in front of names. Always reference ids by using '#' in front of names.

Adjusting the padding, margin, and border of an element:
    All HTML elements are essentially little rectangles. Three important properties control the space that surrounds each HTML element: <padding>, <margin>, <border>.
    An element's <padding> controls the amount of space between the element and its <border>
    An element's <margin> controls the amount of space between an element's <border> and surrounding elements.
    An element's <border> controls the properties of borders: border-style, border-color, border-width, text-align

Add a negative margin to an element:
    If an element's <margin> is set to a negative value, the element will grow larger

Add different padding to each side of an element:
    Sometimes you will want to customize an element so that it has different <padding> on each of its sides. CSS allows to control <padding> of an element of all four sides with <padding-top> <padding-bottom> <padding-right> <padding-left>

Add different margins to each side of an element:
    Sometimes you will want to customize an element so that it has a different <margin> on each of its sides. CSS allows you to control the <margin> of an element of all four sides with <margin-top> <margin-bottom> <margin-left> <margin-right>

Use clockwise notation to specify the padding and margin of an element:
    Instead of specifying an element's <padding> or <margin> properties, you can specify all in one like this:
        padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;
        margin: 10px 20px 10px 20px;
    These four work like a clock: TOP, RIGHT, BOTTOM, LEFT and will produce the exact same result as using side-specific padding or margin instructions

Nest many elements within a single Div element
    The <div> element, aka division element, is a general purpose container for other elements. The <div> element is probably the most commonly used HTML element of all. It's useful for passing the CSS of its own class declarations down to all the elements that it contains. 
    Just like any other non-self closing element, you can open a div element with a <div> and close it on another line with </div>. 

Give a background color to a div element
    You can set an element's background color  with the <background-color> property. Ex:
        <style>
            .green-background{
                background-color: green;
            }
        </style>
        <!-- applying it will be same as applying a class -->

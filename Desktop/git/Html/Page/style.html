Style the HTML body element
    Every HTML page has a <body> element. We can prove that the <body> element exists by giving it a <background-color> of black. Ex:
        <style>
            body{
                background-color: black;
            }
        </style>
        <!-- bg color becomes black -->

Inherit styles from the body element
    Since every HTML page has a <body> element, it can also be styled with CSS. Rmemeber, <body> element can be styled like any other HTML element, and all your other elements will inherit <body> element's styles.

Prioritize One Style Over Another:
    Sometimes HTML elements will receive multiple styles that conflict with one another. Ex: <h1> cannot be both green and pink at the same time. If a class is declared, the class properties will override body elements

Override styles in subsequent CSS
    It doesn't matter which order the classes are listed in the HTML element. However, the order of the <class> declarations in the <style> </style> sections are what is important. The second declaration will always take precedence over the first. 

Override class declarations by styling ID attributes:
    Browsers read CSS from top to bottom. Translation: in event of conflict, browser will use whichever CSS declaration came last. <id> will ALWAYS override <class> attributes in conflicts.

Override class declarations with inline styles:
    <in-line style> will override <id>. Ex:
        <h1 id="id" class="class" style="color: blue"></h1>

Override all other styles by using important:
    In many situations, you will use CSS libraries. These may accidentally override your own CSS. So when you absolutely need to be sure that an element has specific CSS, you use <"!important"> Ex:
        <style>
            color: red !important;
        </style>
        <!-- makes sure element using the color will be red -->

Create a Bootstrap headline:
    First - build jQuery playground from scratch

House page within Bootstrap container fluid div
    Make sure all content on page is mobile-responsive using <container-fluid> class

Create Bootstrap Wells
    Bootstrap has class called <well> that can create a visual sense of depth for your columns

Create a class to target jQuery selectors
    Not every class needs to have corresponding CSS. Sometimes we create classes just for the purpose of selecting these elements more easily using jQuery

Target elements by class using jQuery:
    You see how we made all of <button> elements bounce? We selected them with <$("button")> then we added some CSS classes to them with <.addClass("animated bounce");>. You just used jQuery's <.addClass()> function, which allows you to add classes to elements. First, target <div> elements with the class <well> by using the <$(".well")> selector. Note, just like CSS declarations, you type '.' (period) before the class's name. Then use jQuery's <.addClass()> function to add the clases <animated> and <shake>. For example, you could make all the elements with the class <text-primary> shake by adding the following to your <document ready function>: 
        $(".text-primary").addClass("animated shake");
    Example:
        <script>
            $(document).ready(function() {
                $("button").addClass("animated bounce");
            });
        </script>
